///   relative to instructions — wrong: a stable sort by a two-valued key
///   only preserves order *within* a key group, so a telex that arrived
///   BEFORE an NE/N message still gets pulled to AFTER it (both are just
///   "the `true` group" and "the `false` group" — the telex's true
///   original position is not part of the key at all). We have no
///   response-requirement code to judge telex or an undecodable packet
///   by, so rather than guess, leave the whole batch alone.
/// - **A handover or session-end directive anywhere in the batch.**
///   Unlike every other uplink here, a `HANDOVER <station>`, GOLD
///   `NEXT DATA AUTHORITY`/`END SERVICE`, or bare `LOGOFF` has real side
///   effects beyond the message log — see `poll_once`'s handling arms:
///   they end the current session (superseding whatever is still open)
///   and can fire a new `REQUEST LOGON` for the named successor, all
///   synchronously, before the loop moves on to the next envelope. Every
///   one of these typically carries a no-reply code, so without this
///   guard any of them would be a candidate for being pulled EARLIER in
///   the batch by the very sort this function does — changing not just
///   what the pilot sees but the actual order those side effects run in
///   relative to a reply-owed instruction in the SAME batch. QS round
///   06.09.2026: this guard originally only checked `parse_handover`,
///   which missed the three session-ending forms added alongside it —
