//! Hoppie ACARS network PDC/CPDLC wiring (v1.3.0, #Hoppie-PDC-CPDLC —
//! see docs/spec/v1.3.0-hoppie-pdc-cpdlc.md).
//!
//! ASA-ACARS talks to the free Hoppie ACARS network
//! (`hoppie.nl/acars/`) to let a pilot request a PDC (Pre-Departure
//! Clearance) and exchange CPDLC messages without leaving the app —
//! the protocol/data logic (wire codec, GOLD element table, MIN/MRN
//! threading, PDC formatting) lives in the pure `hoppie-protocol`
//! crate; this module is the thin Tauri-facing wiring layer: shared
//! HTTP client, settings/secrets persistence, the background poller,
//! and the commands the settings panel + (from Phase 2 on) the CPDLC
//! tab call.
//!
//! ## Opt-in by default
//!
//! [`settings::HoppieSettings::enabled`] defaults to `false`. Until a
//! pilot switches it on AND stores a logon code, [`hoppie_connect`]
//! refuses to start — no poller, no requests to hoppie.nl, no
//! notifications. Pilots who don't want PDC/CPDLC at all are entirely
//! unaffected, matching how the LAN remote-control server
//! ([`crate::remote`]) is opt-in.
//!
//! ## Logon-code validation
//!
//! The official docs (`hoppie.nl/acars/system/tech.html`) describe a
//! `ping` request as the way to "test whether the link works" without
//! registering the station as online or locking the callsign — see
//! [`verify_logon`]. [`hoppie_verify_logon_code`] exposes this
//! standalone (for a "Test code" button in the settings panel, before
//! the pilot even saves it), and [`hoppie_connect`] runs the same
//! check before starting the poller, so a stale/typo'd code surfaces
//! immediately as a clear error instead of polling silently into the
//! void.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! [`HoppieHandle`] mirrors `remote::RemoteServerHandle`'s shape: an
//! `Option<HoppieHandle>` field on `AppState`, `Some` while the poller
//! is running, dropping it (via [`hoppie_disconnect`] or app shutdown)
//! fires the stop signal.
